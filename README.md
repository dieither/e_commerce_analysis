## Key Features

* **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, standardizing formats
* **Category & Product Analysis**: Revenue and quantity-based rankings
* **Country-Level Breakdown**: Contribution of different regions to overall sales
* **Temporal Patterns**: Monthly and seasonal dynamics
* **ABC Analysis**: Categorization of products based on cumulative revenue contribution
* **Visualization**: Graphical representation for better understanding

---

## Main Findings

### Product Performance

* High-revenue items are often not the most frequently sold
* Categories like **Office Supplies** and **Technology** dominate revenue
* Pareto principle holds: top \~20% products contribute \~80% of revenue

### Regional Insights

* Key contributing countries identified using ISO codes and region mapping
* Disparities in product demand across regions

### Temporal Trends

* Sales fluctuate across months, with spikes tied to specific seasons or campaigns
* Year-over-year growth (if time range allows)

### ABC Analysis

* Products segmented into A (high value), B (moderate), and C (low value)
* Helps prioritize inventory and marketing strategies

---

## Visualizations

Includes:

* Bar charts of top products and categories
* Line plots for revenue trends over time
* Heatmaps for regional distribution
* Pie charts for contribution breakdowns
* ABC scatter plots with category overlays

---

## Future Work

* Build a sales forecasting model using time series methods
* Apply customer segmentation using RFM analysis
* Create an interactive dashboard (e.g., with Streamlit or Tableau)
* Integrate promotional impact analysis
* Extend ABC analysis with product lifecycle tracking
